    <br>
    <p>It is a routine remediation to address the drainage system problems. By increasing the capacity of the drainage
        system, the effect of the intense rainfall on the slope will be decreased and will address the seepage force
        problem. This can decrease the problems for the geology through decreasing the pore water pressure within the
        soil.</p>
