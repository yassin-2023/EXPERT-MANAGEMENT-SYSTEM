        <p>Applicable for superficial deposits. The application of this remediation depends on the soil type: the lime
            is applicable for fine grained soils. Fly ash is not applicable for fine grained soils, it is more
            appropriate for sands and gravels. However, cement is applicable for different types of soils .</p>

    <h3>Remarks</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>It is used to increase the soil strength through increase its cohesive parameter. It addresses the geology factor
        through increasing the soil resistance by amending the soil with admixtures such as lime, fly ash and cement, as
        a result it reduce the impact of the environment factor on the slope.</p>
