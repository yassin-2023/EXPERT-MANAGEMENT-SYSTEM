        <p>Applicable for embankment and cutting slopes of superficial deposits. For repair settlement it is
            re-elevation of the road using Asphalt as a patching without exceeding the bearing capacity load of the
            foundation. In the case of contaminated land and/or insufficient space, the regrading will be steep angle
            with a sheet pile to achieve the regrading slope. To high slope it is not applicable due to the high cost
            .In the case of flattened slope, it requires sufficient space and awareness of the existence other assets
            (e.g. drainage system, utilities) without encroachment on private properties .</p>

    <h3>Remarks</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This remediation address the topography factor as a result it decreases the impact of the environment and the
        hydrogeology factors through control the velocity of the water and this lead to stabilise the geology.</p>
